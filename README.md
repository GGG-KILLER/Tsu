# Tsu (formerly GUtils)
A general utilities' library I made from things I use frequently in all of my projects.

| Project | NuGet | Status |
| ------- |:-----:| ------ |
| `Tsu` | [![NuGet (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Tsu.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tsu/) | Active |
| `Tsu.CLI` | [![NuGet (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Tsu.CLI.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tsu.CLI/) | Abandoned (System.CommandLine and Cocona are better options for this) |
| `Tsu.Expressions` | [![NuGet (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Tsu.Expressions.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tsu.Expressions/) | Maintenance |
| `Tsu.MVVM` | [![NuGet (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Tsu.MVVM.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tsu.MVVM/) | Abandoned (almost never can I inherit from this class as I need to inherit from some other, so a source generator would be a better option in this case) |
| `Tsu.Parsing.BBCode` | [![NuGet (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Tsu.Parsing.BBCode.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tsu.Parsing.BBCode/) | Maintenance |
| `Tsu.StateMachines` | [![NuGet (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Tsu.StateMachines.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tsu.StateMachines/) | Abandoned (very simple to write your own, no need to have an entire package for it) |
| `Tsu.Testing` | [![NuGet (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Tsu.Testing.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tsu.Testing/) | Abandoned (there's no use for this library) |
| `Tsu.Text.Code` | [![NuGet (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Tsu.Text.Code.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tsu.Text.Code/) | Abandoned (this was just a simple wrapper around `IndentedTextWriter` and can be replaced by it in most cases) |
| `Tsu.Timing.MicroProfiler` | [![NuGet (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Tsu.Timing.MicroProfiler.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tsu.Timing.MicroProfiler/) |
| `Tsu.TreeSourceGen` | [![NuGet (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Tsu.TreeSourceGen.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tsu.TreeSourceGen/) | Active |
| `Tsu.Windows` | [![NuGet (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Tsu.Windows.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tsu.Windows/) | Abandoned (I no longer use Windows nor make any tools that use windows-exclusive features) |
